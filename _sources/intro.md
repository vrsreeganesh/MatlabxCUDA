# An Introduction to Matlab x CUDA 
This book is currently under construction. Please drop by later. (Being a student and writing a book is no joke ðŸ’€)

## But why write a book? (monologue)
This whole thing started cause yours truly couldn't find a good-enough tutorial on using CUDA with Matlab. Finally, after spending months learning it from different books, articles and blogs, I figured I didn't want a fellow student wasting their precious time. So yeah, I had to go all "*Fine, I'll do it myself*" (yup. Thanos) mode. 

The initial plan was to write and publish. But, as someone who learned most of what I know from free resoures like MIT-OCW, YouTube, random blogs and what-not, I figured its only fair that I give back. And I also believe that knowledge should be free. I envision a world where the only thing that stops one from learning, is lack of interest, rather than arbitrary monetary walls. While I do realize that there are aspects of my dream that are just not feasible, I'll do my part to push things closer to it. And that's what I did. Is it difficult to spend time, energy and effort to write a book with seemingly no returns? Sure. But we're all burdened with *glorious purpose*, aren't we? (sorry for the recurrent Marvel references. This is the last one, I swear).  So let me end it with a non-Marvel quote as to why I decided to write this book despite all the challenges. "*We do these things, not because they're easy but because they're hard*". 

So, yeah, here's the book. Its not written the way one expects a standard book to be written. I ride motor-bikes. And one does not simply start teaching a novice by teaching the compression ratios in the engine or how the gears trade off torque for RPMs. Those are fundamental, yes. But that is not how one introduces a novice to the beauty of riding. Borrowing from that, this book is written in the way my brother and my friend taught me to ride motor-bikes: progressive overload. Each chapter introduces a concept that is new and a little bit more complicated than the previous. And its highly practice/implementation based. So, it would be ideal to have a CUDA-powered system by your side. But yeah, to put it simply, I've written it in a way that would maximize the probability of a younger me attaining the present-me's knowledge with minimal time spent. I hope y'all find it useful.

Its not exactly written in a way a standard book must be written. I've written it in such a way that if I were to hand this to a younger-me, it would be the most useful.  -->
