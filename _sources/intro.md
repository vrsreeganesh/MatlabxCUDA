# An Introduction to Matlab x CUDA 
This book is under construction. Please drop by later. (Being a grad-student and writing a book is no joke ðŸ’€)

## But why write a book? (a monologue)
Lets be honest, with the coming of the internet, information is in a surplus, than a deficit. Whether its for the good or bad, lets leave that for middle-schoolers to debate. So a question one would ask oneself when writing yet another book is, "why?". And that is a very fair question to ask if you're a wannabe author. After all, why would anyone write a book when there is an ocean of resources out there in the form of books, YouTube videos and lecture-slides. 

And to that, my answer was, for the very same reason there is NPTEL, MIT-OCW and Stanford-Online. One of the fears of Professor Strang (MIT Professor, famous for his 18.06 Linear Algebra lectures) was his fear that one day every student will have learned from the same source. While I do not share that fear, I do believe in the power of choice. Since everyone is not made the same, there is an expected difference in the way people learn. I'll confess that the best book to learn this is Programming Massively Parallel Processors by David Kirk and Wen-mei Hwu. Its easily the best book for CUDA out there. Hands down. In fact, if you have time and you would like to learn this topic with rigour, I would suggest starting there. 

One of my Professors at Boston University writes great notes. His notes on Optimization are an absolute joy to read due to the sheer personality that is infused with the content. And that's the kind of book/notes that I love. The kind of notes that feels like there is a person on the other side walking you through it. So the whole question of, "why write *another* book?", went out the window for me. 

The side-quest to write this book started cause yours truly couldn't find a tutorial that matched the best way I learn. So I found myself going through a large number of resources. And this, "book", started out as markdown file on my Mac. And I kept adding to it as I learned. 

So once I started polishing up my notes, the plan was to see if I could publish someway. But that didn't feel right. As someone who learned most of what he knew from free resources like MIT-OCW, I figured its only fair to give back. And this way, I also get to continuously add more things to it cause, surprise, surprise, I'm a student too. 

End of the day, I believe that knowledge should be free. I envision a world where the only thing that stops one from learning is lack of interest, rather than some arbitrary monetary walls. While I do realize that there aspects of my dream thats just not feasible, I'll do my part to push things closer to the ideal. And this book is one of the ways I choose to do it. Is it difficult to spend time, energy and effort to write a book that will, probably, produce no returns? Absolutely. But to paraphrase JFK, we do these things, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. Because the goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills. And if there's one thing that defines engineers, its that we learn by doing. Acta non verba. 

So, here's the book. The way it teaches the reader stems from another part of my life: motorbikes. I love em. And one does not simply start a novice by teaching the compression ratios of the engine or how the gears trade-off torque for RPMs. Those are fundamental, yes, but irrelevant to a beginner. Borrowing from that, this book is written the same way my brother and my friend taught  me to ride motorbikes: progressive overload. You start by learning how to get on the bike, putting the gear in neutral, turning it on, putting it in first gear and slowly releasing the clutch while you gradually accelerate the bike. Similarly, the first few sections are going to be trivially simple. But I assure you the scripts and lessons get sophisticated as you move through it. And its highly practice/implementation based. So, having a CUDA-powered system by your side would be ideal. But to conclude, this book is essentially written for beginners and in a way that would maximize the probability of a younger-me attaining the present-me's knowledge with minimal time expenditure. I hope y'all find it useful.
