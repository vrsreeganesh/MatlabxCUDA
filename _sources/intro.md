# An Introduction to Matlab x CUDA 
This book is under construction. Please drop by later. (Being a grad-student and writing a book is no joke ðŸ’€)

## But why write a book? (a monologue)
Lets be honest, with the coming of the internet, information is in a surplus, than in a deficit. Whether its for the good or bad, lets leave that for middle-schoolers to debate. So a question one would ask oneself when writing yet another book is, "why?". And that is a very fair question to ask if you're a wannabe author. Why would you write a book when there is an ocean of resources out there in the form of books, YouTube videos and lecture-slides. 

And to that, my answer was, for the very same reason there is NPTEL, MIT-OCW and Stanford-Online. One of the fears of Professor Strang (MIT Professor, famous for his 18.06 Linear Algebra lectures) was his fear that one day every student will have learned from the same source. While I do not share that fear, I do believe in the power of choice. Since everyone is not made the same, there is an expected difference in the way people learn. I'll confess that the best book to learn this is Programming Massively Parallel Processors by David Kirk and Wen-mei Hwu. Its easily the best book for CUDA out there. Hands down. 

The side-quest to write this book started cause yours truly couldn't find a tutorial that matched the best way I learn. So I found myself going through a large number of resources. And this, "book", started out as markdown file on my Mac. And I kept adding to it as I learned. 

One of my Professors at Boston University writes great notes. His notes on Optimization are an absolute joy to read due to the sheer personality that is infused with the content. And that's the kind of book/notes that I love. The kind of notes that feels like there is a person on the other side walking you through it. So the whole question of, "why write *another* book?", went out the window for me. 

So once I started polishing up my notes, the plan was to see if I could publish someway. But that didn't feel right. As someone who learned most of what he knew from free resources like MIT-OCW, I figured its only fair to give back. And this way, I also get to continuously add more things to it cause, surprise, surprise, I'm a student too. 

End of the day, I believe that knowledge should be free. I envision a world where the only thing that stops one from learning is lack of interest, rather than some arbitrary monetary walls. While I do realize that there aspects of my dream thats just not feasible, I'll do my part to push things closer to the ideal. And this book is one of the ways I choose to do it. Is it difficult to spend time, energy and effort to write a book that will, probably, produce no returns? Absolutely. But to paraphrase JFK, we do these things, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. Because the goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills. And if there's one thing that defines engineers, its that we learn by doing. Acta non verba. 



<!-- This whole thing started cause yours truly couldn't find a good-enough tutorial on using CUDA with Matlab. Finally, after spending months learning it from different books, articles and blogs, I figured I didn't want a fellow student wasting their precious time. So yeah, I had to go all "*Fine, I'll do it myself*" (yup. Thanos) mode.  -->

<!-- The initial plan was to write and publish. But, as someone who learned most of what I know from free resoures like MIT-OCW, YouTube, random blogs and what-not, I figured its only fair that I give back. (Also, I'm a continuous improvement guy. So I don't really like the idea of writing a book and just stopping there. I'm rather apprehensive of its static attribute. But this way, I can keep adding more and more stuff to it as I learn cause, surprise surprise, I'm a student too. That being said, I'll also be writing a script that automatically renders a LaTeX book. That way, this is accessible to people who prefer it as a book too. But yeah, back to the monologue). I also believe that knowledge should be free. I envision a world where the only thing that stops one from learning, is lack of interest, rather than arbitrary monetary walls. While I do realize that there are aspects of my dream that are just not feasible, I'll do my part to push things closer to it. And that's what I did. Is it difficult to spend time, energy and effort to write a book with seemingly no returns? Sure. But we're all burdened with *glorious purpose*, aren't we? (sorry for the recurrent Marvel references. This is the last one, I swear).  So let me end it with a non-Marvel quote as to why I decided to write this book despite all the challenges. "*We do these things, not because they're easy but because they're hard*".  -->

So, yeah, here's the book. Its not written the way one expects a standard book to be written. The approach stemmed from another aspect of my life: motor-bikes. I love em. And one does not simply start a novice by teaching the compression ratios in the engine or how the gears trade off torque for RPMs. Those are fundamental, yes. But that is not how one introduces a novice to the beauty of riding. Borrowing from that, this book is written in the same way my brother and my friend taught me to ride motor-bikes: through progressive overload. You start by learning how to get on the bike, putting it in neutral, turning it on, putting it in gear, release clutch slowly, while slowly accelerating the bike. Similarly, the first section gives you a low-resolution of the whole thing. Then, each chapter introduces a concept that is new and a little bit more complicated than the previous. And its highly practice/implementation based. So, it would be ideal to have a CUDA-powered system by your side. But yeah, to put it simply, I've written it in a way that would maximize the probability of a younger me attaining the present-me's knowledge with minimal time spent. I hope y'all find it useful.

So, here's the book. The way it teaches the reader stems from another part of my life: motorbikes. I love em. And one does not simply start a novice by teaching the compression ratios of the engine or how the gears trade-off torque for RPMs. Those are fundamental, yes, but irrelevant to a beginner. Borrowing from that, this book is written the same way my brother and my friend taught  me to ride motorbikes: progressive overload. You start by learning how to get on the bike, putting the gear in neutral, turning it on, putting it in first gear and slowly releasing the clutch while you gradually accelerate the bike. Similarly, the first few sections are going to be trivially simple. But I assure you the scripts and lessons get sophisticated as you move through it. And its highly practice/implementation based. So, having a CUDA-powered system by your side would be ideal. But to conclude, this book is essentially written for beginners and in a way that would maximize the probability of a younger-me attaining the present-me's knowledge with minimal time expenditure. I hope y'all find it useful.
