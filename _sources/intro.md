# An Introduction to Matlab x CUDA 
This book is currently under construction. Please drop by later. 

(Being a student and writing a book is no joke ðŸ’€)

## But why write a book (monologue)
This whole thing started cause yours truly couldn't find a good-enough tutorial on using CUDA with Matlab. Finally, after spending months learning it from different books, articles and blogs, I figured I didn't want other students like me wasting their precious time. So yeah, I had to go all "Fine, I'll do it myself" (yup. Thanos) mode. 

The initial idea was to publish as a book but then, as someone who learned most of my topics-of-interest from free resources like MIT-OCW, random blogs and what-not, I figured its only fair that I give back. Knowledge should be free. I envision a world where the only thing that stops someone from learning is the lack of interest and never monetary walls. Is it difficult to spend time and effort to write a book with no immediate-gains? Sure. But its all about *glorious purpose*, isn't it? (sorry for the recurrent Marvel references). So let me end it with a not-marvel quote. "*We do these things, not because they're easy but because they're hard*". So yeah, here's the book. Its not exactly written in a way a standard book must be written. I've written it in such a way that if I were to hand this to a younger-me, it would be the most useful. 

(*you sly dog, you got me monologuing*)
