# [Beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming)

Beamforming is a signal processing technique that originates from the design of spatial filters into pencil shaped beams to strengthen signals in a specified direction and attenuate signals from other directions. Beamforming is applicable to either radiation or reception of energy. Here, we consider the reception part. 

A beamformer is a processor used along with an array to provide a versatile form of spatial filtering. It essentially performs spatial filtering to separate signals that have overlapping frequency content but generate from different spatial directions.
