# [Beamforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming)

Beamforming is a signal processing technique that originates from the design of spatial filters into pencil shaped beams to strengthen signals in a specified direction and attenuate signals from other directions. Beamforming is applicable to either radiation or reception of energy. Here, we consider the reception part. A beamformer is a processor used along with an array to provide a versatile form of spatial filtering. It essentially performs spatial filtering to separate signals that have overlapping frequency content but generate from different spatial directions.


Beam forming or spatial filtering is the process by which an array of large number of spatially separated sensors discriminate the signal arriving from a specified direction from a combination of isotropic random noise, called ambient noise, and other directional signals. In the following simulations, we deal with a number of equally spaced elements separated by a distance of λ/2 , where λ is the wavelength of the frequency for which the beam former is designed.

The assumptions under which we perform the simulations are 
- The noise is anistotropic. 
- Ambient noise at the sensor-to-sensor output is uncorrelated
- The signal at the sensor-to-sensor outputs are fully correlated
